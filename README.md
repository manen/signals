# `signals`

silly signal game

## roadmap

what's left:

- [ ] implement moves mapping, inputs, outputs, and foreigns across worlds n everything too

and we'll have a really really dumbed down bad version of worlds in blocks

i'm not deleting these even tho theyre done, but dymamiclayable needs:

- if im guessing right when taking, drop runs when self is dropped, fix that
- just litter the fucking code with null checks
